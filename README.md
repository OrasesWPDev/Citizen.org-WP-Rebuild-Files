# Public Citizen Website Rebuild Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive analysis and technical planning documentation for the Public Citizen website rebuild project.

## Project Overview

The Public Citizen website (citizen.org) currently uses an over-engineered WordPress architecture with 7 custom post types and 6 custom taxonomies that create unnecessary complexity for content creators. This rebuild project aims to simplify the content management experience while preserving the current visual design.
